# Overview

This software is an arithmatic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. It can handle multiple integers and has a failsafe if an incorrect text is entered.

This software was written to help develop learning in the C++ language, including functions, loops, variables, conditionals, and expressions.

# Future Work

There are a few things I can do to increase my knowledge in this language and improve this program. Namely:

- If I were to do this again, I would make it possible to input decimals for more precise calculations.
- Using classes for larger programs helps keep programs clean, and I could do a better job at implementing them earlier in my code, as well as learn more things about classes that can help my code run smoother and appear cleaner.
- I didn't use any arrays in this program, but those are often simpler and more compatible with the base C++ language, and could help me simplify some of my code.
